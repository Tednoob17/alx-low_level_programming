course or any equivalent graduation as a basic building block. Please keep in mind there is no need to be engineering
graduation it can be any graduation that is related to Computer science.


2.2. Skills
Next, you need to check the skills that a cyber security professional has which is really important to handle the security threats that are really happening suddenly and should be resolved in real-time as soon as possible. The skills needed for a cyber security professional are

use only Linux for preparing the lab. Go and check simple hacking and security tools at first. Keep in mind to get
maximum knowledge before practicing a tool. Also, be careful about the threats while checking for the tools. Work with
firewalls and security measures to get more knowledge.


6. Select your path
In this milestone, there will be a lot of roads you can see. As we discussed above there are a lot of cyber security jobs
